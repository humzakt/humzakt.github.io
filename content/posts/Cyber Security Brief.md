## July 3, 2022

Will the #government remove #TickTock from #Apple and #Google stores?
Read below to find out🔽

- A new sophisticated #malware is attacking SOHO routers.

  Why so complicated malware for SOHO routers? They are easily penetrable. I believe the malware is too fancy to be used "just" for a #botnet. They might be preparing for a larger attack.

- A study released by
  @CerbyHQ
  and
  @OstermanRsch
  shows over half of employees use prohibited apps.

  Why wouldnt they? The end user wants full control. I believe technical prohibition as well as awareness is the best way to prevent this.

- #Google has been working up on #Workspace to prevent against #bots and #APi #vulnerabilities.
- Critical
  @manageengine
  AdAudit #vulnerability allows mass network takeover which allows mass data exfilteration.
- US government has asked #Apple and #Google to remove #TickTock from their stores.
  As the previous news also states user wants full control. I dont think this decesion will go through as #GenZ is highly interested in this platform. 😁

- #NorthKorean #Lazarus Group is back in the news.
  According to
  @elliptic
  , the group allegedly stole $100M in Harmony Hack.
- @opensea
  has disclosed a #databreach waning users of #PhishingScam.
  So if someone asks to buy your #NFTs on great prices. You better beware.
  Has #Web3 provided a new platform for #scammers to steal money?

- AstraLocker 2.0 infects users directly from Word attachments.

  Educate your users. Don't download unknown stuff. Make sure your endpoints are secure.

## July 2, 2022

From taking down planes to Phishing Sites #UkraineWar has shown its true potential.
Read below to find out more🧵

- @NATO
  to create rapid response cyber force to strengthen cyber defenses.

  The changing times are showing the potential of #cyberwar causing countires to reconsider cyber defense tactics.

- @FBI
  has warned companies regarding #deepfake interviews and jobs which were being highlighted alot this week

- #Shipping Industry is again in hot waters as they are deemed vulnerable to multiple attacks as these companies are increasing vessel connectivity but doing the bare minimum for #CyberSecurity.

  @bcs_erictaylor
  stated again and again : "Compliance is not Protection"

- So #indian governement wanted #VPN providers to store customer data which would render the privacy useless. This defeats the purpose of a vpn. The rule implementation is delayed but vpn companies have hinted leaving the country because of it.

- The #CSO at
  @Uber
  paid the ransom to #hackers and told them to sign an NDA stating that they didnt steal data. Like burhhh🤯.
  He has been charged with #wirefraud as he tried to cover up the attack through this method.
- Another one for #Ukraine️,
  Ukraine police arrested a gang opereting 400 phishing sites which were used to steal consumer data.
  Way to go Cyber Team🚀🚀

- @firefox
  has been updated to protect against #Follina vulnerability which gave powershell access. So update your browsers ASAP.
- A report by
  @TetraDef
  states that 82% of cyber attacks were possible due to unpatched sites. Which essentially means that #hackers googled their way into a site without any efforts🤯

  Updated your sites and patch the vulnerablities everyone.🤞

## June 30, 2022

Imagine a tech #interview where the candidate looks real but is not?
The fascinating world of #deepfake. Want to know what happened ?

- #StolenPII and #deepfakes are used to apply for tech jobs. The interviewer realized some lag in the answers which upon investigation got to the conclusion.
- Russia fines foreign firms like #twitch and
  @UPS
  for data violations as they want the data of its citizens to be stored in Russia.
- Another one from #SocialEngineering attempts:
  Messenger chatbots are being used to #steal Facebook accounts and further banking data.
  The attackers create a messenger profile similar to official
  @facebook
  and social engineering users into the attack.
- So
  @AMD
  employees had passwords like "123456" and "welcome123" which were used to hack into the company and weak #securityProtocols allowed them to access common Admin Protocols and data.
- One for the #DevOps professionals :
  Nearly one million misconfigured Kubernetes are exposed online which are vulnerable to data exfiltration and other vulnerabilities.
  Advice from
  @barricadecyber
  : Keep scanning for your data and vulnerabilities yourself and stay Updated.
- @Android
  #spyware is now being used as a banking trojan.
  Even though
  @android
  provides more config than
  @Apple
  but the #IOS ecosystem is more secure from external attacks as agreed upon by both
  @barricadecyber
  and
  @Gerald_Auger
  . Internal reporting is another story.
- As we move towards #QuantumComputing, businesses believe they will have to rethink #cybersecurity and we are more in need of Post Quantum Encryption Algorithms.
  Who will win, Hackers or Experts? We will soon find out😊

## June 29, 2022

- Sky Mavis to reimburse victims of Ronin bridge hack.
  Will they be able to afford ths?💵
- Contractor loses a city’s worth of personal data.
  This japanese guy had all this data on a USB and went roaming in the city😂
- @CarnivalCruise
  agrees to pay $1.5million for the data breach.
  Well said by
  @barricadecyber
  "A drop in a bucket for them"
- #KillNet claims DDoS on #Lithuania
- #Ransomware gang launches #BugBounty for #Lockbit.

  Before this news, i didnt even know ransomware-as-a-service was a thing😅

## June 28, 2022

- @Microsoft
  Edge Webview2 allows hackers to steal user Cookies🍪 which allows them to bypass MFA.
  Not the users fault but idk who uses edge or its webview🤔

- Russia-linked hackers caused the explosion at #Texas Natural Gas Plant?
  This feelz like some is watching
  @whoismrrobot
  😁

- @Google
  reveals sophisticated malware targeting victims in #Italy & #Kazakhstan .
  The thing to note is that the #ISP was in on this as well. How?🤔
  Idk, i wasnt the hacker😂

- So according to
  @Gerald_Auger
  , people might be blaming everything they dont figure out to CyberAttack. As the rocket-attack false alarm in #Israel was a "suspected" cyberattack🚀

- @VMware
  servers are still being exploited with #Log4Shell. Too hard to fix for IT or are the #Management Noobs not ready to invest?🤔

- @CarnivalPR
  has been fined 5 #million #dollars for #cybersecurity violations resulting is back to back cyber attacks. But this is somehow a good thing for
  @GEppinger
  (former ciso) according to
  @Gerald_Auger
  . Fascinatting stuff. Hopefully i get the same🚀🤞
- As #crypto markets collapse, the electricity footprint is decreasing due to miners shutting off their rigs until it again gains pace🚀🚀
  @elonmusk
  where are u?🚀😂
- And lots of #ransomware stuff due to social engineering, budget cuts and ignoring the warnings of cybersecurity engineers😂

## June 25, 2022

- Cloud emails threats soar. Phishing and Social Engineering are on the rise.
  Best way to keep educating your users. There is nothing as "one time training"

- Covid-19 text scam for collecting data on the rise.
  @Gerald_Auger
  says the ROI is not good😂

- #Russian APT Fancy Bear uses NUKE threat using 1-click bug (for botnet?🤔)

- Another phishing attack,
  @MetaMask
  phishing scam uses KYC lures users to steal passphrases
- @QNAP_nas
  devices running old software are vulnerable to remote attacks.
  @Gerald_Auger
  goes laughing😂
- @Microsoft
  to use AI for
  @msftsecurity
  to predict #Ransomware attacks
  Way to go🎊

- @amazon
  Alexa could turn dead loved ones voices into digital assistants.
  I agree with
  @Gerald_Auger
  that this technology would possibly be used to fake different voices. Probably into some other kind of phishing & social engineering attack?🤔

- I believe we need to continuously keep users educated with on going scams and attacks. We need more content creators like
  @Gerald_Auger
  and
  @NetworkChuck
  who explain complex attacks in simple terms to spread awareness.
  Education is best protection

## June 24, 2022

- A Daycare app was insecure and could be use to steal data. It already had different Ad vulnerabilities.
  Cause: The devs and the users are too non-techy to know😅

- @MEGAprivacy
  says that the data is totally secure and even they cant access it. However recent POC exploit says otherwise. 🤔(nice?)

- @Microsoft
  to retire facial emotional scanner from tbe users. However it will be used for other products. 🤔 sus

- Code executions is a devs nightmare and recent vulnerability in
  @splunk
  enterprise solution allows the former🤐❌
- According to
  @NSOgroup
  , #Pegasus is used by atleast 5 #EU countries.🤔
  I think everyone is using it. One way or another🔥
- @DARPA
  says #blockchain is vulnerable to centralized controlled through 51% ownership.

  Multiple #Web3 sources claim thats it is not financially viable, but is financial viability the only reason for this?🤔

- @brave
  has improved its search 5000% and apparently it is competing with
  @DuckDuckGo
  with additional filters. Congrats team🎊

- Another #phishing gang taken down my #EU cops. I think its the biggest win for the law enforcement as it is getting good pace at catching #cyber criminals😁

## June 23, 2022

- @Cloudflare outage hit many websites including some crypto exchanges.

- @POTUS
  signed #CyberSecurity bills to promote training of federal cyber employees. Hopefully we will see something like that in Pakistan someday.

- #7zip now supports "Mark of the Web" feature. It would try to prevent downloaded malware by preventing unzip of marked zip files
- @Microsoft
  Windows fixes office 365 issues on ARM devices. Finally the company is considering these devices as well.🙂
- Another vulnerability #icefall effects multiple industrial devices. Good luck explaining the need of new devices to executives😂
- Toddycat APT targets
  @Microsoft
  Exchange servers in Europe and Asia
- Finally the threats of using APIs is being considered. Distribution of processes is good but at what risk? 🤔
- #Russian APT28 with a funny bear name hacks
  @NATO
  think tank in Germany. Who knows what might be compromised🤐

## June 22, 2022

- The most important method to be secure is by educating your end user as thats the most vulnerable point of the system.

- Keep your systems up to date. Even if it requires extra effort, update your systems to avoid last minute crisis and data leaks.

- Be aware of on going attacks so that you can be prepared for safeguard and security of your system.

## June 21, 2022

- QNAP devices are again in the news due to their exploits. Make sure all your devices are patched and updated.

- US DoJ put down Russian RSOCKS botnet which exploited everything which had QNAP NAS to gain access.

- In the #RussianUkrainianWar the cyber warfare is not that much as expected in present day and age. Or are we less informed?🤔

- There is a browser extension that lets you hide search results. Why would i need it? I dont know❌

- And again @Android #malware #BRATA is evolving and exploiting more devices. Make sure to keep your devices updated and dont trust anything from unknown sources.

- @WSJ says "Crypto Party is Over"@Gerald_Auger replies "They have just gone to get more beer"😂 I think the game is just started and its only a small adjustment which WSJ will see after some time.
