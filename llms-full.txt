## Building an AI Evaluation Platform on GCP: Architecture of a Multi-Cluster System

URL: https://humzakt.github.io/blog/building-ai-evaluation-platform-gcp.html

How do you evaluate whether an AI coding agent is actually good at writing code? Over the past 6 months, Humza Tareen built a production AI evaluation platform on GCP. The architecture includes multiple Cloud Run services with auto-scaling (0-100 instances per service), multiple GKE clusters (up to 39 nodes, n2-standard-8 + n2-highmem-4), Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instances with Regional HA, dozens of Pub/Sub topics with dead-letter queues, multiple Firestore databases, GCS storage buckets, and Cloud Tasks for reliable async execution.

Key services: Evaluation Engine (task lifecycle management), Auto-Rating Service (LLM output scoring via LiteLLM proxy), RAG Retrieval Service (pgvector similarity search), RL Training Arena (Gym-style reinforcement learning), Guard Service (Google OIDC, JWT, API keys), Notification Service (Cloud Tasks with exponential backoff), Workflow Orchestration (WebSocket HITL workflows).

Key decision: Cloud Run for stateless request-response (scales to zero, bills per-request), GKE for stateful long-running workloads (persistent connections, GPU access). Both AlloyDB and Firestore used — AlloyDB for ACID transactions and complex JOINs, Firestore for real-time state and sub-second writes.

Numbers: High merge rate, continuous deployment, hundreds of issues filed and resolved across severity levels.

Tech stack: Python (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic), TypeScript (React), GCP (Cloud Run, GKE, Cloud Tasks, Pub/Sub, AlloyDB, Firestore, Cloud Build, GCS, Cloud Scheduler, Secret Manager, Cloud Monitoring), PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, GitHub Actions.

## Event-Driven Architecture on GCP: Pub/Sub, Cloud Tasks, and Cloud Scheduler

URL: https://humzakt.github.io/blog/event-driven-architecture-gcp-pubsub.html

The AI evaluation platform has a 6-phase pipeline where each evaluation takes 5-30 minutes and touches 6 different services. Synchronous HTTP would mean timeouts and retry nightmares. With events, each service subscribes independently and retries from its own checkpoint.

Phases: Task Creation → Preprocessing → Agent Execution → Output Collection → Judging & Scoring → Aggregation & Learning. Each phase communicates via Pub/Sub topics.

Key patterns: Fan-out (one topic, multiple subscriptions — adding a new consumer requires zero changes to the publisher), Dead-letter queues on every production topic (5-retry policy, weekly DLQ review caught 3 schema migration issues, 1 Firestore quota limit, 2 Cloud SQL connection failures), Cloud Scheduler for automation (scheduled jobs publish to Pub/Sub topics).

Monitoring: Every Cloud Run service has an alert at >5% error rate. CPU utilization monitoring at <10% to auto-detect idle VMs saves ~40% on compute costs.

Key lessons: Message ordering doesn't matter with proper design. Acknowledge after commit, not before. Schema evolution is inevitable — version your message schemas. Pub/Sub for events, Cloud Tasks for commands.

## Debugging AlloyDB SSL Connection Drops

URL: https://humzakt.github.io/blog/debugging-alloydb-ssl-connection-drops.html

Random SSL connection failures causing 5% of AI evaluation tasks to fail. Root cause: AlloyDB silently drops idle SSL connections after ~10 minutes, but SQLAlchemy's connection pool (configured for 15-minute recycle) kept serving dead connections.

Fix: Set pool_recycle=180 (recycle before AlloyDB kills them), pool_pre_ping=True (validate on checkout), pool_size=5 + max_overflow=10. Combined with idempotent writes for Cloud Tasks retry safety. Result: 5% failure rate → 0.01%.

## Idempotent Cloud Tasks Handlers in Python

URL: https://humzakt.github.io/blog/idempotent-cloud-tasks-handlers-python.html

Cloud Tasks guarantees at-least-once delivery. The 3-step pattern: (1) Deterministic IDs from payload using SHA-256 hashing, (2) INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING, (3) Always return HTTP 200 (returning 409 causes infinite retries). Cap Cloud Run containerConcurrency to 10-20 (not 80) to prevent database connection exhaustion. This pattern handles thousands of tasks per day with zero duplicates.

## Zero-Downtime Embedding Migration in Production RAG System

URL: https://humzakt.github.io/blog/rag-embedding-migration-zero-downtime.html

Embedding model got deprecated overnight. 48-hour migration plan: (1) Make model configurable via env vars, (2) Add new vector columns (don't replace — ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN + CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY), (3) Batch re-embedding with progress tracking, (4) Feature flag switch (USE_V2_EMBEDDINGS), (5) Validation comparing old vs new search results (82% average overlap). 48 hours, zero downtime, zero data loss.

## Security Audit: Critical Security Gaps Found

URL: https://humzakt.github.io/blog/security-audit-ai-platform-25-critical-issues.html

Systematic audit of production AI evaluation platform. Critical findings: SQL injection (BigQuery f-strings), hardcoded credentials in alembic.ini, secrets in CI/CD logs, missing authentication on 3 internal endpoints, PII in plaintext logs. Architecture issues: monolithic God Class, V1/V2 dependency leakage, in-memory rate limiting (doesn't work across Cloud Run instances), CPU-bound algorithms blocking async event loop.

Fixes: All secrets to GCP Secret Manager, parameterized queries, structured logging with PII stripping, authentication middleware on every endpoint, pre-commit hooks (ruff, type checking, security scanning). Broke God Class into 5 focused services. Built LLM Gateway abstraction. Moved rate limiting to Redis. Hundreds of GitHub issues filed across severity levels.
